# Basic-Vanilla-JS-caculator

What is is? 

It is a simple vanilla JavaScript calculator. It allows the user to add, subtract, multiply, divide, clear numbers, and continue math operations after getting an answer. 

What I learned

- This wasn't very challenging. I didn't learn any specific concept, but rather general practice of basic JavaScript. Afterall, practice makes perfect.
- I also built this impulsively. I really want to use it to compare it with how other more experienced people have made calculators in ES6. That way I can learn some better practices. I'm certain that I still have a lot to learn and my go to programming strategies can always improve.
